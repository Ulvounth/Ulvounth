<h1>Hello world! I am Andreas, presently pursuing a Front-end Development program at Noroff</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>
Originally hailing from Norway, but currently, I call Spain my home as I immerse myself in the world of Front-end Development. When I'm not diving into the intricacies of coding, you'll often find me pursuing my various interests.


I'm an avid computer enthusiast, always eager to explore the latest technologies and software. Gaming is another passion of mine, as I love to get lost in virtual worlds and engage in exciting adventures. On the flip side, I'm equally enthusiastic about the real world, especially when it comes to football and golf. Whether it's watching a thrilling match or teeing off on the golf course, these sports add balance and excitement to my life.

In essence, I'm a curious individual with a penchant for both the digital realm and the physical world, making my journey into Front-end Development a fascinating and fulfilling one.
