<h1>Hello world! I am Andreas, presently pursuing a Front-end Development program at Noroff</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>
I'm originally from Norway, but right now, I'm living in Spain and learning Front-end Development. When I'm not coding, I'm a big computer geek â€“ always checking out new tech and software. I'm also a gamer, and I enjoy getting lost in virtual worlds and having exciting adventures.

On the other hand, I'm also into real-life stuff, like football and golf. Whether it's watching an exciting game or playing a round of golf, these sports bring balance and excitement to my life.

I'm a curious person who's into both digital and real-world things, and my journey into Front-end Development is pretty awesome.
